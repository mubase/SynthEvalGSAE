SynthEvalGSAE
=============

SC testing platform for optimizing Perceptually Transparent Algorithmic Efficiency (as defined by D Jaffe) in Granular Synthesis; to find out if an aethetically compelling, musically engaging real-time  granular synthesis implementation can be developed for 8bitAVR and 32bitARM microcontrollers, on platforms used by musicians and artists. If the inefficiencies inherent in granular synthesis could be minimized or overcome, could Granular Synthesis become as familiar to musicicians and artists as standard wavebased synthesis, beyond the gates of academia? Or, is the particle-like nature of sound destined to remain firmly in the field of Digital Audio Effect Processing due the comparative prevalence of Time-domain Granulators.
